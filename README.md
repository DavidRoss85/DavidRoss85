## 👋 Hi, I’m David Ross

I’m a **software engineer and robotics graduate student at Northeastern University**, focused on building real-world autonomous systems, perception pipelines, and intelligent software that actually ships. I enjoy working across the full stack — from low-level hardware and sensors to high-level algorithms and user-facing tools.

### 🧠 Current Focus
- Robotics, perception, and autonomous navigation (ROS 2, computer vision, sensor fusion)
- Backend and systems programming in **Python & Java**
- Algorithm design, data structures, and real-time systems

### 🚀 What I’m About
- Turning messy real-world problems into clean, working systems  
- Building things that move, see, decide, and act  
- Writing code that other engineers can actually understand and extend  

### 🤝 Open to Collaboration
I’m always open to collaborating on:
- Robotics & autonomy projects  
- Computer vision & mapping  
- Backend systems & APIs  
- Research-driven or experimental builds

### ⚡ Background
Former healthcare professional with **13 years of clinical experience** — now fully committed to engineering, robotics, and intelligent systems. I bring real-world pressure, discipline, and problem-solving into every project I touch.
